# Ignore false positive error categories:
# DAR402: Darglint cannot trace into called functions to see they raise exceptions.
#         Functions calling yaml.safe_load, json.loads, etc. DO propagate exceptions
#         but darglint flags Raises sections as "excess" because it only analyzes
#         the immediate code.
# DAR202: Protocol methods with `...` body define interfaces. They SHOULD document
#         Returns but darglint sees ellipsis as "no return statement" and flags
#         Returns as excess.
