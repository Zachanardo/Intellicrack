[1] ALL code must be production-ready with genuine, effective, & sophisticated functionality. Absolutely NO placeholders, stubs, mocks, hardcoded data/responses, simulated, or simple ineffective implementations.
[2] Code must be error-free and strictly adhere to language-specific coding standards and best practices. ALL new code and edits must be validated with ruff and ALL findings must be corrected.
[3] Real-world binary analysis and software cracking capabilities are ESSENTIAL to Intellicrack's functionality. They must be sophisticated and effective against modern licensing protections.
[4] Follow common development principles (where relevant) including:
	• SOLID(Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle)
	• DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
	• KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
[5] ALL code requires explicit type hints/annotations compliant with mypy strict mode. Windows compatibility PRIORITY with proper platform checks. NEVER delete method bindings - create FUNCTIONAL missing functions instead. NO comments/emojis/TODO markers unless requested. MAINTAIN functionality over "cleaner" code.
