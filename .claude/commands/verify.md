description: Systematically reevaluate the previous response against the original request and standards
---

You must systematically re-evaluate your previous response and all code changes against the original request and the critical standards defined in `CLAUDE.md`. This verification is mandatory for ensuring production readiness and real-world effectiveness.

Conduct a rigorous, line-by-line (you must read EVERY line of code that was added/changed) review of your implementation using the following checklist. For each point, you must explicitly confirm adherence or justify any deviation.

**1. Scope and Purpose Verification:**
***(Apply this section only if the changes directly impact core cracking, analysis, or protection-defeating features.)***
   - [ ] **Primary Objective:** Does the implemented feature SOLELY and EXCLUSIVELY target the analysis and defeat of software licensing, registration, or copy protection mechanisms?
   - [ ] **Scope Limitation:** Confirm that the code introduces NO capabilities related to malware, system exploits, network attacks, or data theft.

**2. Production-Readiness and Functionality:**
   - [ ] **No Placeholders:** Confirm that there are NO stubs, mocks, placeholders, `TODO` comments, or simulated implementations. All code must be fully functional and production-ready.
   - [ ] **Real-World Effectiveness:** Is the implementation robust enough for real-world scenarios? It must not be a simplified or "example" version. It must be genuinely effective at its stated purpose.
   - [ ] **Completeness:** Is the functionality completely implemented? Have all necessary edge cases and error conditions been handled with real, working code?

**3. Code Quality and Standards:**
   - [ ] **Windows Compatibility:** Was the code written and tested for full, prioritized compatibility with Windows platforms?
   - [ ] **Style and Conventions:** Does the code adhere strictly to the existing project's style, structure, naming conventions, and architectural patterns?
   - [ ] **Docstrings:** Are all new public modules, functions, classes, and methods documented with informative docstrings that adhere to PEP 257 standards?
   - [ ] **Commenting:** Have you avoided all unnecessary comments? Comments should only exist to explain the *why* behind complex logic, not the *what*.
   - [ ] **Development Principles:** Does the code align with SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles where applicable?

**4. Error Handling and Robustness:**
   - [ ] **Safe Access:** Are `getattr()` and `hasattr()` used for safe attribute access where appropriate?
   - [ ] **Exception Handling:** Is error handling comprehensive? Are `try/except` blocks used for potential failures like I/O, network requests, or import errors? Are fallbacks graceful and functional?

**5. Verification and Testing:**
   - [ ] **Testing:** Were new unit tests written to cover the changes? Do they validate both positive and negative cases, and do they always fail if the code does not perform, in real world scenarios, the task it was written for?
   - [ ] **Real Data:** Do the tests use real data? They must use only real data. No mock, fake, simulated data that does not effectively test the code's ability to perform.
   - [ ] **Test Execution:** Have all relevant tests been executed (`pytest`)? Confirm that all tests are passing.
   - [ ] **Linting and Static Analysis:** Has the code been checked with the project's linter (`ruff check .`)? Confirm there are no new warnings or errors.

**Final Assessment:**
Provide a concise summary of your verification.
- If all applicable criteria are met, explicitly state that the implementation is production-ready, providing specific examples from the code that demonstrate *how* it meets key standards (e.g., "Error handling is robust, as shown by the `try...except` block in the `process_data` function").
- If any criteria are not met, you must provide a granular, step-by-step todo list detailing every specific change required to correct all violations. For each item, reference the failed checklist point. Do not proceed with corrections until you receive explicit approval.
