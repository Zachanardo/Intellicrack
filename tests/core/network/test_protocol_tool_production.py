"""
This file was deleted due to extensive mock usage violating Group 3 testing requirements.

See: tests/core/network/test_protocol_tool_production_DELETED.md for details.

All tests in this file used unittest.mock (MagicMock, Mock, @patch) to simulate:
- ProtocolFingerprinter
- TrafficInterceptionEngine
- Qt QApplication objects

Per the requirement: "If a test cannot work without mocks, DELETE the test entirely."

To restore coverage, rewrite tests using real PCAP files and direct function testing.
