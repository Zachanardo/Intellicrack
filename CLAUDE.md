## 📝 Development Guidelines

### 🚨 **CRITICAL CODING RULES**
- **NEVER add unnecessary comments** in code
- **Comments only when explicitly requested** by user
- **No explanatory comments** about imports or fixes
- **Keep code clean** without redundant explanations
- **NEVER delete method bindings or function calls without thorough analysis.** If bindings reference functions that don't exist, CREATE THE MISSING FUNCTIONS instead of removing the bindings - they were written for a reason. Method bindings in this codebase serve important architectural purposes and removing them breaks functionality.
- **ALL FIXES MUST MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE INTELLICRACK'S FUNCTIONALITY** - Never sacrifice functionality for cleaner code. Test fixes thoroughly to ensure they don't break existing workflows. When fixing linting errors, the goal is to make the code work better, not to disable features.

### Error Handling Protocol
- **Use safe attribute access** with `getattr()` and `hasattr()`
- **Implement platform compatibility** checks
- **Provide graceful fallbacks** for missing dependencies
- **Validate function parameters** before calling
- **Handle import errors** with try/except blocks

### Architectural Principles
- **Modular design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency injection** for optional components
- **Event-driven UI** with proper signal/slot connections
- **Thread-safe operations** for long-running tasks
- **Memory-efficient** handling of large files

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Additional analysis engine integrations
- Extended plugin ecosystem
- Cloud-based analysis options
