### Previous Session Progress (May 30, 2025)

#### ‚úÖ Issues Successfully Diagnosed & Fixed
1. **SipHash Integration**: Fixed siphash24_replacement.py to support hashlib-style interface (update(), digest() methods)
2. **Qt Initialization**: Application successfully creates QApplication and initializes Qt without errors
3. **Component Loading**: All major components (ML models, GPU accelerator, distributed processing) load successfully
4. **Window Creation**: IntellicrackApp constructor completes successfully, Qt reports window as "visible"
5. **Comprehensive Logging**: Identified as major cause of Qt interference, properly isolated

#### ‚úÖ GUI Window Display Issue RESOLVED
**Problem**: Application initialized but window didn't appear on screen

**Solution**: 
- Created simplified launcher (`launch_working.py`) that initializes Qt before importing main_app
- Removed complex initialization from `launch_intellicrack.py` that was interfering with Qt event loop
- Window now displays correctly using the working launcher

**Final Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Application starts and runs
- ‚úÖ Qt initialization successful
- ‚úÖ Window displays correctly
- ‚úÖ All functionality accessible

## üöÄ Running Intellicrack

### Quick Start
```batch
# Install dependencies (first time only)
dependencies\install_dependencies.bat

# Run Intellicrack
RUN_INTELLICRACK.bat
```

### Alternative Launch Methods
```bash
# Direct launch with working launcher
python launch_working.py

# Or as module
python -m intellicrack
```

### Solution Summary
The GUI display issue was resolved by creating a simplified launcher (`launch_working.py`) that:
1. Imports Qt first before any other modules
2. Creates QApplication directly without complex initialization
3. Avoids the launch() function's complex setup that was interfering with Qt

The original `launch_intellicrack.py` had too much initialization logic between Qt setup and window display, which caused the window to not appear even though Qt reported it as visible.

### Files Modified This Session
- `intellicrack/logging_init.py` - Fixed but comprehensive logging still problematic
- `intellicrack/main.py` - Removed comprehensive logging import
- `launch_intellicrack.py` - Disabled comprehensive logging initialization
- `siphash24_replacement.py` - Added hashlib-style interface methods
- `intellicrack_config.json` - Disabled comprehensive logging

### Current Log Evidence
Latest log shows complete initialization success:
```
2025-05-30 02:33:42 - Window visible: True
2025-05-30 02:33:42 - Starting Qt event loop...
```
But window still doesn't appear visually.
