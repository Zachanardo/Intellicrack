# Intellicrack

## Project Overview

**Intellicrack** - Advanced binary analysis platform **SPECIFICALLY AND
EXCLUSIVELY** designed for analyzing software and cracking licensing
protections. This tool focuses **SOLELY** on defeating software licensing
mechanisms, registration systems, trial limitations, and copy protection
schemes.

### EXPLICIT TOOL SCOPE - CRITICAL

**What Intellicrack IS:**

- **SOFTWARE LICENSING CRACKER** - Defeats licensing protections, serial
  validation, and registration systems
- **PROTECTION ANALYZER** - Analyzes and bypasses copy protection, trial
  limitations, and activation mechanisms
- **BINARY PATCHER** - Modifies binaries to remove licensing checks and
  protection routines
- **LICENSE KEYGEN CREATOR** - Generates valid license keys and registration
  codes

**What Intellicrack IS NOT:**

- **NOT a malware creation tool** - No malware injection, payload delivery, or
  virus creation
- **NOT a system exploit framework** - No OS exploitation, privilege escalation,
  or system compromise
- **NOT a network attack tool** - No network intrusion, packet injection, or
  remote exploitation
- **NOT a data theft tool** - No credential harvesting, data exfiltration, or
  information stealing

**SCOPE LIMITATION:** This tool is **EXCLUSIVELY** for analyzing and defeating
software licensing protections. Any functionality must be directly related to
cracking software protections, NOT creating other types of exploits.

### Project Intent & Security Research Purpose

This tool is developed for **defensive security research** to help software
developers:

- **Identify weaknesses** in their own licensing protection mechanisms by using
  Intellicrack in a controlled enviornment to crack their software, so they can
  strengthen the licensing protections to prevent future attacks.
- **Test robustness** of licensing, registration, and activation systems in
  controlled environments
- **Strengthen licensing defenses** against cracking attempts by understanding
  bypass techniques
- **Validate protection effectiveness** of their own software's licensing
  mechanisms before deployment

**Critical Context:** Intellicrack requires functionally real and robust
licensing cracking capabilities to serve as an effective security research tool.
All components must be production-ready to accurately defeat protection
mechanisms and provide meaningful security insights to developers working to
improve their software's licensing security.

**Usage Environment:** This tool operates exclusively in controlled, isolated
research environments for authorized security assessment of proprietary software
licensing systems by their own developers and security teams.

**TOOLS**

## USE THESE TOOLS

1. rg instead of grep
2. fd instead of find
3. tree is installed

## CRITICAL: VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT USAGE

**Environment Usage:**

- **Pixi environment location**: `D:\Intellicrack\.pixi\envs\default`
- **Activation**: `pixi shell` or use `pixi run <command>`
- **Claude Code runs natively on Windows**

## 🔧 CRITICAL CODING RULES

### Code Style

- **NEVER add unnecessary comments** - Keep code clean
- **NO explanatory comments** about imports, fixes, or obvious code
- **Comments ONLY when user explicitly requests**
- **NEVER use emojis in code or responses unless explicitly requested** - No
  emojis in any output.
- **ALL code must include proper type hints and annotations** - Every function,
  method, and variable must have explicit type checking.
- **Follow common development principles (where relevant) including:** •
  **SOLID** (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov
  Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency
  Inversion Principle) • **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) • **KISS** (Keep It
  Simple, Stupid)

### Implementation Standards

- **ALL CODE MUST BE WRITTEN FOR FULL COMPATIBLITY WITH WINDOWS PLATFORMS AS A
  PRIORITY.**
- **NO STUBS, MOCKS, OR PLACEHOLDERS** - ALL code must be FULLY FUNCTIONAL
- **NO TODO COMMENTS** - Implement REAL functionality immediately
- **NO SIMULATION MODES** - Real licensing cracking tool only
- **NEVER delete method bindings** - CREATE MISSING FUNCTIONS instead
- **ALL METHODS MUST WORK ON REAL BINARIES** - Specifically for cracking
  licensing protections
- **MAINTAIN FUNCTIONALITY** - Never sacrifice features for "cleaner" code
- **SCOPE ENFORCEMENT** - Every feature must relate to SOFTWARE LICENSING
  CRACKING
- **NO MALWARE CAPABILITIES** - No injection, payload delivery, or system
  exploitation code
- **LICENSING FOCUS ONLY** - All analysis must target registration, activation,
  and licensing protection systems
- **NO "example" implementations that would need to be replaced**
- **NO simple implementations that would be ineffective in real world
  scenarios**

### Production-Ready Code Only

**When writing code, Claude must:**

- Implement all functionality completely
- Use real, working implementations for every feature
- Handle edge cases and errors properly
- Write code that could be deployed immediately
- If external data is needed, implement proper data fetching/handling
- If configuration is needed, use proper environment variables or config files
- Make manual fixes directly without creating automation scripts unless
  specifically asked

**If a request would require placeholder code to demonstrate, Claude should
instead:**

- Ask for the specific requirements needed to write production code
- Request any necessary API endpoints, data structures, or specifications
- Explain what information is needed to create a fully functional implementation

**This is non-negotiable: Every line of code Claude writes must be ready for
production use.**

### Error Handling

- Use `getattr()` and `hasattr()` for safe attribute access
- Implement platform compatibility checks
- Provide graceful fallbacks, written in REAL production-ready code for missing
  dependencies
- Handle import errors with try/except blocks

### MCP Configuration

**Config location**: `~/.claude.json`
