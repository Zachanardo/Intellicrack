# Report and Export Templates

This directory is designated for templates used by the reporting and export modules. Currently, templates are primarily generated programmatically or stored in other locations within the application.

## Future Template Types:
- PDF report templates
- HTML export templates
- Markdown documentation templates
- Script generation templates

When templates are added to this directory, they will be used by the reporting and export modules for customized output formatting.
