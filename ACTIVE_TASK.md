# ACTIVE TASK: Implement Intellicrack Validation Framework

## Task Status: IN PROGRESS
## Current Phase: 1
## Current Step: 1.1

---

## IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVE

Implement the Intellicrack Validation Framework following the plan in C:\Intellicrack\Validation_Framework.md EXACTLY as specified.

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION - ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY
- Complete EVERY checkbox item in Phase 0 before starting Phase 1
- Complete EVERY checkbox item in Phase 1 before starting Phase 2
- Continue this pattern through all phases
- NO SKIPPING STEPS - even if they seem redundant
- NO COMBINING STEPS - each must be completed individually
- Document completion of each step with actual output/evidence

### 2. CODE QUALITY - ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY
- EVERY function must be production-ready and fully functional
- NO placeholder functions - must perform real operations
- NO stub code - must have complete implementations
- NO mock objects - must use real system resources
- NO simulated functionality - must perform actual work
- NO hardcoded results - must compute real outputs
- NO TODO comments - implement immediately
- NO "simple" implementations - must handle all edge cases
- NO empty catch blocks - must handle errors properly
- NO functions that always return success - must validate properly

### 3. PHASE GATE ENFORCEMENT
- At the end of each phase, execute the MANDATORY CODE REVIEW section
- Run ALL specified verification tools (pylint, ruff, mypy)
- If ANY non-production code is found, STOP and fix it
- Do NOT proceed to next phase until current phase passes review
- Document the review results for each phase

### 4. EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
- For each completed step, provide evidence of completion
- Show actual command outputs, not descriptions
- Include file hashes, timestamps, and screenshots where specified
- Create all specified directories and files with real content
- Test all code with real inputs and show actual results

### 5. IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICS
- Use real commercial software binaries as specified in Phase 0
- Implement actual protection detection algorithms, not pattern matching
- Create real binary analysis capabilities, not lookups
- Generate actual cryptographic proofs and signatures
- Perform real statistical analysis with proper mathematics
- Create genuine forensic evidence collection, not logs

### 6. FAILURE CONDITIONS
- If you cannot implement something with production code, STOP
- If you need to use placeholder code, STOP and explain why
- If a step requires resources you don't have, STOP and document
- Do NOT continue with partial implementations
- Do NOT mark steps complete without full functionality

## START IMPLEMENTATION

Begin with Phase 0, Section 0.1.1 - Create the secure storage directory.
Show the actual command executed and its output.
Then proceed to 0.1.2, and continue sequentially through EVERY checkbox.

## PROGRESS TRACKING

After completing each major section (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.3), provide a summary:
- Steps completed with evidence
- Code files created with line counts
- Tests executed with results
- Any issues encountered and how resolved

## REMEMBER
- This validation framework will determine if Intellicrack is production-ready
- Any fake implementations will invalidate the entire framework
- Follow the plan EXACTLY - no shortcuts, no optimizations, no skipping
- Each step builds on the previous - breaking sequence breaks the validation
