Add SQLite and Memory back to YOUR MCP servers. But, I think that all or most of the ones you removed might
  benefit the actual Intellicrack app, which got me thinking... Could we add a module to Intellicrack that would
  allow users to add and configure MCP servers, that can be called upon automatically by whatever AI model the user
   imports into Intellicrack? Possibly include a guide for the user within the app for specific steps on
  configuring an MCP server within the app? I think it could be placed in the GUI in the settings tab, under a sub
  tab called MCP Servers.
