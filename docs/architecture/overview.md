### Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each component is self-contained with well-defined interfaces
2. **Extensibility**: Plugin system allows for custom functionality
3. **Performance**: GPU acceleration and distributed processing support
4. **Flexibility**: Multiple analysis engines with graceful fallbacks
5. **Security**: Sandboxed execution environments for untrusted code

## Core Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Binary Loading
```python
Binary File → PE/ELF/Mach-O Parser → Internal Representation
```

### 2. Static Analysis
- Disassembly (Radare2, Capstone)
- Control Flow Graph generation
- String extraction
- Import/Export analysis
- Signature matching

### 3. Dynamic Analysis
- Emulation (QEMU, Qiling, Unicorn)
- Debugging (Frida, native debuggers)
- API monitoring
- Behavior analysis

### 4. Vulnerability Detection
- Pattern matching
- Symbolic execution (angr)
- Taint analysis
- ML-based prediction

## Key Subsystems

### AI Integration Layer

The AI subsystem provides:
- Multiple LLM backend support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local models)
- Vulnerability prediction using trained ML models
- Code generation and analysis assistance
- Natural language interface for complex queries

### Network Analysis

Network capabilities include:
- Traffic capture and analysis
- Protocol fingerprinting
- License server emulation
- SSL/TLS interception
- Cloud license bypass

### Distributed Processing

For large-scale analysis:
- Ray framework for distributed computing
- Dask for parallel data processing
- GPU acceleration with CUDA/OpenCL
- Container-based isolation

### Plugin System

Extensibility through:
- Custom Python modules
- Hot-reload capability
- Sandboxed execution
- Standardized API
