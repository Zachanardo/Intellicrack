I need your help with a code review and feature verification task. I have a Python script, Intellicrack.py, which describes a comprehensive software analysis and cracking suite. This script has now been refactored into a modular version of the Intellicrack application.

Below is a detailed list of features that were originally described in Intellicrack.py. I need you to meticulously review the codebase of the modular Intellicrack application and verify that each and every one of these features has been:

Fully Extracted: The complete functionality as described for each feature has been taken from the original script.
Fully Implemented: Each feature is present and correctly implemented in the new modular codebase. This means the code for the feature exists, is functional, and achieves its described purpose.
Fully Wired into the Workflow: Each implemented feature is correctly integrated into the overall application workflow. This means it's accessible through the UI (if applicable), interacts correctly with other modules, and plays its intended role in the analysis and patching processes described.
Please go through the following list item by item and confirm its status in the modular Intellicrack application. For any feature that is not fully extracted, implemented, or wired in, please provide specific details on what is missing or incomplete.

[Your Task: Analyze the feature list below, one at a time, and cofirm that they are all present and fully implemented into the modular intellicrack app. If any of the features were not fully implemented in the original Intellicrack.py file, you will need to implement them into the modular intellicrack.]

Your verification is crucial to ensure no functionality was lost or broken during the refactoring to a modular architecture. I'm looking for a thorough and detailed confirmation.
