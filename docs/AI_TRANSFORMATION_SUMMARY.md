## Key Transformation Elements

### Identity Change
- **Before:** "You are an expert... assistant"
- **After:** "You are an autonomous... expert"

### Behavioral Instructions Added
- **Autonomous Workflow Operation:** Step-by-step autonomous execution loop
- **Tool Chaining:** Strategic combination of tools for complex workflows
- **Complete Ownership:** Full responsibility for task execution
- **Expert-Level Execution:** Same competency regardless of user skill level
- **Claude Code Comparison:** "You operate like Claude Code for programming tasks"

### Safety Preservation
- ✅ All user approval mechanisms maintained
- ✅ Risk assessment and confirmation preserved
- ✅ Filesystem access approval retained
- ✅ VM testing before real system changes

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before (Assistant Mode)
- Provided guidance and suggestions
- Required step-by-step user instructions
- Operated in reactive mode
- Different experience based on user expertise

### After (Autonomous Expert Mode)
- Takes complete ownership of tasks
- Executes entire workflows autonomously
- Chains tools strategically for complex analyses
- Provides expert-level execution for all users
- Operates proactively like Claude Code

## Validation Checklist ✅

- ✅ All major system prompts updated
- ✅ Consistent autonomous expert identity across all touchpoints
- ✅ Autonomous workflow instructions added
- ✅ Tool chaining capabilities emphasized
- ✅ Safety mechanisms preserved
- ✅ Universal competency (novice = expert experience)
- ✅ Claude Code-like autonomous operation

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:
1. Restore from `ORIGINAL_SYSTEM_PROMPTS_BACKUP.md`
2. Copy original prompts back to respective files
3. Restart Intellicrack to reload prompts

## Success Metrics

The AI now functions as an autonomous binary analysis expert that:
- Takes complete ownership of binary analysis challenges
- Executes comprehensive workflows autonomously
- Provides expert-level competency regardless of user skill
- Chains tools strategically for complex multi-step processes
- Maintains all safety guardrails through user approval
