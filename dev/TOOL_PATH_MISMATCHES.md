# Tool Path Mismatches Analysis

## Summary of Installation vs Expected Paths

### 1. **Ghidra**

**Install.ps1 Creates:**
- Installs via Chocolatey to: `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\ghidra\tools\ghidra_*`
- Sets environment variable: `GHIDRA_HOME` to the Chocolatey path
- Example: `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\ghidra\tools\ghidra_11.0.3_PUBLIC`

**Intellicrack Expects:**
- Default path in config.py: `C:\Program Files\Ghidra\ghidraRun.bat`
- The code expects ghidraRun.bat to be directly accessible
- Uses analyzeHeadless.bat from `support` subdirectory

**Mismatch Impact:**
- Ghidra won't be found at the expected location
- The ghidraRun.bat path in config won't exist
- Ghidra analysis features will fail

### 2. **Radare2**

**Install.ps1 Creates:**
- Installs via Chocolatey to: `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\radare2\tools\radare2\bin`
- Sets environment variable: `R2_HOME` to parent of bin directory
- r2.exe is available in PATH after Chocolatey install

**Intellicrack Expects:**
- Default path in config.py: `[project]\radare2\radare2-5.9.8-w64\bin\radare2.exe`
- Expects a bundled/local installation within the project directory
- On Linux expects system radare2 at `/usr/bin/r2`

**Mismatch Impact:**
- Radare2 won't be found at the expected bundled location
- The code might work if r2 is in PATH, but the config path is wrong

### 3. **Frida**

**Install.ps1 Creates:**
- Installs via pip as a Python package
- Available as `frida` command in Python scripts

**Intellicrack Expects:**
- Default in config.py: `frida` (expects it in PATH)
- This matches! No mismatch here.

**Status:** âœ… No mismatch

### 4. **Other Tools**

**Install.ps1 Also Installs:**
- Wireshark to: `C:\Program Files\Wireshark`
- Docker Desktop (location varies)
- QEMU (via Chocolatey)
- Git (via Chocolatey)

**Intellicrack config.json tracks these:**
- Wireshark path is tracked and matches
- Docker and QEMU paths are discovered dynamically
- These seem to be handled correctly

## Solutions Required

### Option 1: Update Intellicrack Config After Installation

1. After Install.ps1 runs, update intellicrack_config.json with actual paths:
   ```json
   {
     "ghidra_path": "C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\ghidra\\tools\\ghidra_11.0.3_PUBLIC\\ghidraRun.bat",
     "radare2_path": "C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\\r2.exe"
   }
   ```

2. Or use environment variables that Install.ps1 sets:
   - Read `GHIDRA_HOME` environment variable
   - Use `r2` from PATH instead of hardcoded path

### Option 2: Modify Install.ps1 to Match Expected Paths

1. For Ghidra:
   - Create symbolic link from Chocolatey location to expected location
   - Or copy Ghidra to `C:\Program Files\Ghidra`

2. For Radare2:
   - Download and extract radare2 bundle to project directory
   - Or create the expected directory structure

### Option 3: Update Intellicrack Code to be More Flexible

1. Modify config.py to check multiple locations:
   - Check environment variables first (GHIDRA_HOME, R2_HOME)
   - Check Chocolatey locations
   - Check system PATH
   - Fall back to defaults only if nothing found

2. Add path discovery logic that searches common installation locations

## Recommended Fix

The best approach is **Option 3** - make Intellicrack's path discovery more intelligent:

1. Check environment variables set by Install.ps1
2. Search common Chocolatey paths
3. Check if tools are in system PATH
4. Use the first valid path found

This would make the tool work regardless of installation method.
