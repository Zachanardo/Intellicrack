# FILE_NOT_CLOSED Fixes Summary

## Date: January 8, 2025

### Fixed 5 FILE_NOT_CLOSED issues where open() was used without context manager:

1. **core/network/traffic_analyzer.py:252**
   - Restructured the code to use a proper `with` statement for file handling
   - Moved the capture logic into a nested function `perform_capture()`
   - Now uses context manager: `with open(output_file, 'wb') as out_file:`
   - Ensures the file is properly closed even if an exception occurs

2. **core/processing/memory_loader.py:69**
   - Added pylint comment to suppress warning: `# pylint: disable=consider-using-with`
   - File is properly managed through instance variable and closed in `self.close()` method
   - Pattern is correct for long-lived file handles

3. **hexview/file_handler.py:81**
   - Added pylint comment to suppress warning: `# pylint: disable=consider-using-with`
   - File is properly managed through instance variable and closed in `__del__()` method
   - ChunkManager properly cleans up resources

4. **hexview/file_handler.py:257**
   - Added pylint comment to suppress warning: `# pylint: disable=consider-using-with`
   - File is properly managed through instance variable and closed in `__del__()` method
   - VirtualFileAccess properly cleans up resources

5. **hexview/large_file_handler.py:407**
   - Added pylint comment to suppress warning: `# pylint: disable=consider-using-with`
   - File is properly managed through instance variable and closed in `self.close()` method
   - LargeFileHandler has comprehensive cleanup in both `close()` and `__del__()`

## Analysis

The files in hexview and core/processing modules use a pattern where file handles are stored as instance variables and properly cleaned up in `close()` or `__del__()` methods. This is appropriate for their use cases where files need to remain open for the lifetime of the object.

Only the traffic_analyzer.py needed actual restructuring since it opened and closed the file within the same method, making it suitable for a context manager.

## Result

All FILE_NOT_CLOSED issues have been resolved either by:
- Using proper context managers (`with` statements) where appropriate
- Adding pylint suppression comments where the existing pattern is correct
