# USER_INPUT Validation Fixes Summary

## Fixed Security Issues

### 1. scripts/cli/ai_wrapper.py:96
**Issue**: Raw user input from `input()` function without validation
**Fix**: Added comprehensive input validation:
- Validates input to only allow specific characters: 'y', 'n', 'd', or empty string
- Handles EOFError and KeyboardInterrupt exceptions gracefully
- Provides clear error messages for invalid input
- Prevents injection of malicious input

### 2. scripts/cli/pipeline.py:63
**Issue**: `validate_input()` method always returned True without actual validation
**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive validation logic:
- Type checking for PipelineData instance
- Format-specific validation (json, binary, text, csv)
- JSON serialization testing
- File path validation for binary format
- Metadata validation
- Security checks to prevent path traversal attacks
- Blocks access to sensitive directories (/etc/, /root/)

### 3. scripts/cli/pipeline.py:343
**Issue**: Uses the unimplemented validator that was fixed in issue #2
**Fix**: The validator is now properly implemented and additionally:
- Added validation in `parse_pipeline_command()` function:
  - Command string validation and length limits
  - Detection of suspicious patterns (exec, eval, __import__, etc.)
  - Limits number of pipeline stages to prevent DoS
  - Validates allowed commands only
  - Validates transform types
  - Validates output paths with security checks
- Added validation in `main()` function:
  - Input file path validation and existence checking
  - File size limits (100MB for files, 10MB for stdin)
  - Chunked reading from stdin to prevent memory issues
  - Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

## Security Improvements

1. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are now validated against whitelists
2. **Path Traversal Prevention**: File paths are resolved and checked against sensitive directories
3. **Size Limits**: Implemented to prevent memory exhaustion attacks
4. **Error Handling**: All exceptions are caught and handled gracefully
5. **Command Injection Prevention**: Pipeline commands are parsed safely with pattern detection

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various malicious inputs:
   - Path traversal attempts (../../etc/passwd)
   - Large files/stdin input
   - Invalid pipeline commands
   - Special characters in input

2. Verify proper behavior:
   - Valid inputs work as expected
   - Invalid inputs are rejected with clear messages
   - No crashes or unexpected behaviors
