# Utils __init__.py Import Fixes Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Restored Essential Imports to __all__
Previously, many functions that were explicitly imported were missing from the `__all__` list. This has been fixed by:

- Adding all imported functions from each module to `__all__`
- Maintaining proper organization with comments indicating source modules
- Ensuring compatibility with existing code that depends on these exports

### 2. Removed Duplicate Entries
Found and removed 11 duplicate entries:
- `get_target_process_pid` (appeared 3 times)
- `compute_file_hash` (appeared 3 times)
- `run_incremental_analysis` (appeared 2 times)
- `run_memory_optimized_analysis` (appeared 2 times)
- `run_comprehensive_analysis` (appeared 2 times)
- `run_deep_license_analysis` (appeared 2 times)
- `run_ghidra_analysis_gui` (appeared 2 times)
- `create_sample_plugins` (appeared 2 times)
- `load_ai_model` (appeared 2 times)

### 3. Properly Handled Aliased Imports
- `log_message` from tool_wrappers is imported as `tool_log_message`
- This is correctly reflected in the `__all__` list

### 4. Final Statistics
- Total unique exports: 239
- All imported functions are now properly exported
- No duplicates remain
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Impact
This fix ensures that all modules importing from `intellicrack.utils` will have access to all the functions that are actually imported and available within the module, preventing ImportError exceptions at runtime.
