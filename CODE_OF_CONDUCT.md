## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on ethical security research.

## Ethical Usage and Research Purpose

- **Validate security** of their own software before deployment

### Acceptable Use

- Testing your own software and applications
- Authorized security research with proper permissions
- Educational purposes in controlled academic environments
- Vulnerability research on systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test

❌ **PROHIBITED**:
- Any unauthorized testing, analysis, or exploitation of software you do not own
- Bypassing, cracking, or circumventing protections on software without explicit permission
- Commercial piracy or enabling software piracy

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also extends to the use of Intellicrack software - users are expected to use the tool ethically and in compliance with applicable laws.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
