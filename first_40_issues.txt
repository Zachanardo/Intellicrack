**Issues in this file:** 1

#### 1. [ ] `generate_keygen_template()` - CRITICAL (Line 152)

**Confidence:** 112%

**Issue Type:** `stub_detection`

**Description:** 7 production issues detected

**Evidence:**

- CRITICAL: Keygen lacks cryptographic operations (insufficient for production) (+90 points)
- CRITICAL: Keygen without loops or conditionals (linear execution only) (+75 points)
- Keygen with trivial complexity (insufficient for production) (+50 points)
- Keygen with minimal local state (incomplete implementation) (+45 points)
- Keygen sophistication score: 0% (INSUFFICIENT) (+70 points)
- Low complexity for domain-specific function (likely incomplete) (+35 points)
- Deductions for production patterns (-140 points)

**Suggested Fix:** Review and implement production-ready functionality

### File: `.\intellicrack\core\analysis\protection_scanner.py`

**Issues in this file:** 1

#### 1. [ ] `_analyze_protection_strings()` - CRITICAL (Line 664)

**Confidence:** 125%

**Issue Type:** `naive_implementation`

**Description:** 3 production issues detected

**Evidence:**

- Protection analyzer without signature database (weak detection) (+60 points)
- CRITICAL: Analyzer without binary format parsing (string matching only) (+75 points)
- Deductions for production patterns (-10 points)

**Suggested Fix:** Review and implement production-ready functionality

### File: `.\intellicrack\core\analysis\radare2_advanced_patcher.py`

**Issues in this file:** 2

#### 1. [ ] `_generate_c_patcher()` - CRITICAL (Line 1239)

**Confidence:** 360%

**Issue Type:** `hardcoded_return`

**Description:** 5 production issues detected

**Evidence:**

- CRITICAL: Patcher without pattern search (hardcoded offsets only) (+85 points)
- Patcher without format parsing (not PE/ELF aware - dangerous) (+70 points)
- Patcher without backup capability (destructive without safety) (+50 points)
- CRITICAL: Patcher without conditionals (blindly patches - dangerous) (+75 points)
- Patcher sophistication: 20% (DANGEROUS - will break on updates) (+80 points)

**Suggested Fix:** Implement actual binary patching with proper file I/O and byte manipulation

#### 2. [ ] `generate_patch_script()` - HIGH (Line 1180)

**Confidence:** 85%

**Issue Type:** `stub_detection`

**Description:** 3 production issues detected

**Evidence:**

- Patcher function with no loops and no file I/O (incomplete) (+50 points)
- Keygen function with no crypto/random operations (trivial algorithm) (+45 points)
- Deductions for production patterns (-10 points)

**Suggested Fix:** Review and implement production-ready functionality

### File: `.\intellicrack\core\analysis\radare2_ai_integration.py`

**Issues in this file:** 2

#### 1. [ ] `_train_license_detector()` - HIGH (Line 673)

**Confidence:** 97%

**Issue Type:** `naive_implementation`

**Description:** 6 production issues detected

**Evidence:**

- Protection analyzer without signature database (weak detection) (+60 points)
- CRITICAL: Analyzer without binary format parsing (string matching only) (+75 points)
- Analyzer without loops (single pattern check only) (+55 points)
- Analyzer sophistication: 10% (WEAK - misses most protections) (+70 points)
- Low complexity for domain-specific function (likely incomplete) (+35 points)
- Deductions for production patterns (-100 points)

**Suggested Fix:** Review and implement production-ready functionality
